This plugin uses the Tool Tip / Balloon functionality of Vim to display Tool
Tips for code. Currently only Tcl and AWK are supported.

Tool Tips are displayed for commands, variables and user defined procedures /
functions. If spellchecking is enabled will also display possible corrections.
The current buffer is checked for user defined procedures / functions when it
is written to disk.
