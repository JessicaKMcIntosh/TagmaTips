This plugin uses the Tool Tip / Balloon functionality of Vim to display Tool
Tips for code. Currently only Awl, Tcl and Vim are supported.

==============================================================================
DESCRIPTION					*TagmaTips-description*

Tool Tips are displayed for commands, variables and user defined procedures /
functions. If spellchecking is enabled will also display possible corrections.
The current buffer is checked for user defined procedures / functions when it
is written to disk.

See the GitHub URL above for more information and screenshots (in the wiki)

INSTALLATION					*TagmaTips-installation*

Copy the files to your ~/.vim or ~/vimfiles directory.
If using a package manager like pathogen place the whole directory in the
bundle directory.

SUPPORTED TYPES					*TagmaTips-Types*

AwK	Locates user defined functions.

	Supports most Tcl variables and primitives.

	If enabled the data loaded from eval.txt will be cached.

==============================================================================
SETTINGS					*TagmaTips-settings*

*g:TagmaTipsEnableCache*

TODO						*TagmaTips-Todo*

* Support more file types.

* Better documentation.

==============================================================================
ADDING FILE TYPES 				*TagmaTips-adding-types*

To add new file types the file "plugin/TagmaTips.vim" needs to be modified.
The file type needs to be added to the Dictionary "g:TagmaTips#Settings. See
the comments for details of what to add.

Additionally for primitives and variables to be loaded properly an autoload In
order for primitives and variables to exist for tool tips they must be defined
in an file type specific autoload plugin. The name of the file is
"autoload/TagmaTips#.vim" where '#' is the file type identifier, eg. "awk".
When a file type is setup the function "LoadSettings" is called from the file
type specific autoload file.

File types can have a custom function to lookup tool tips. If the settings key
"expr" exists for a file type that function is called if the tool tip can not
be found in the normal lists. For an example see "autoload/TagmaTipsvim.vim".

It is suggested to copy the settings and autoload files for an exist file type
and modify them to match your language.
